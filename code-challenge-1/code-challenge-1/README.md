##  Code-Challenge-1

## Scenario 1
In a futuristic city, a brilliant scientist unveils a revolutionary time-travel device. However, a glitch in the system prevents him from accessing specific time coordinates. Desperate for a solution, he seeks a coding genius to fix the issue and extract crucial data from the past. Will you be the one to decipher the temporal anomaly and save the scientist's groundbreaking invention?

## Scenario 2
In the competitive world of virtual reality gaming, a talented gamer strives to achieve a perfect score of 100, unlocking the legendary title of "Master Player."
