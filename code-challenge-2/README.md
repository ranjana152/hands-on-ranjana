##  Code-Challenge-1

## Scenario 1
Amelia, an aspiring mathematician, discovered a magical equation etched into an ancient artifact. It revealed that a mysterious number increased by 7 equals 22. Eager to unlock the secret, she devised a function to unveil the initial number's value. As she delves into the enchanting world of numbers, help Amelia decipher the ancient riddle and unlock the hidden mathematical wonders within the artifact.

## Scenario 2
In a realm of mythical adventures, our brave hero embarks on a mission to conquer the formidable castle guarded by powerful dragons. Armed with a specific number of bullets, each capable of slaying two dragons, he faces the daunting challenge. As the hero calculates his odds, a mysterious function comes to his aid, revealing whether he carries enough firepower to emerge victorious against the dragon guardians and fulfill his destiny.

## Scenario 3
In a quaint village, the townsfolk celebrate the changing seasons with each passing month. A wise mathematician devises a function that effortlessly determines the quarter of the year based on the numeric representation of the month. As the villagers plan their festivals and activities, this function becomes a valuable tool, guiding them seamlessly through the transitions of spring, summer, autumn, and winter.

## Scenario 4
In a bustling city, a diligent waiter introduces a futuristic tipping calculator that responds to various service ratings. As diners enjoy their meals, the calculator seamlessly computes tips based on the dining experience. A touch of innovation ensures fair compensation: "Terrible" warrants a 0% tip, "Poor" receives a 5% acknowledgment, "Good" merits a 10% appreciation, "Great" enjoys a 15% nod, and "Excellent" is rewarded with a generous 20% tip, making the dining experience not only delicious but also gratifying.

## How to Use?
Alas, for all the money in the world, he can't find a decent programmer to help him with this task. He's designed the front-end of the application and it looks great. He needs **YOU** to help him code functionalities in the back-end though. Go to the `src/app.js` file and complete all the unfinished code to propel this young man's football dream.
